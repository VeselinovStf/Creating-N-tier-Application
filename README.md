# Creating-N-tier-Application
Pluralsight Creating N-Tier Applications in C#  Course Repo

## [Part 1](https://github.com/VeselinovStf/Creating-N-tier-Application/tree/master/Part_01 "Part 1") 

In part 1 of the course, goal is to  learn the pros and cons of separating applications into tiers, and two different ways to go about doing so.

In part 1 of this series, you'll learn why separating software application logic into layers is a common practice, as well as some pros and cons of doing so. You'll see how monolithic applications can evolve into N-Tier applications, including two approaches: Data Centric and Domain Centric (or DDD) designs.

## Summary



-  N-Tier Design can refer to both the logical and physical separation of responsibilities within an application  
- The terms tier and layer may be used interchangeably, though each has specific meaning as well  
- Logical separation into layers can improve code maintainability  
- Physical separation into tiers can provide scalability, security, and fault tolerance, among other benefits  
- Applications can evolve over time as their needs require the complexity of an N-Tier design  
- Avoid making end runs around layers in your application
